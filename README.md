# Zencord
A firefox extension that adds a 'zen mode' to Discord when you press F2.

---

## Installation
I'm too lazy to publish this to Firefox's store. So just sideload it:

> NOTE: You can only sideload addons if you use ESR, Developer, or Nightly editions of Firefox.
- Open `about:config`
- Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false.
- [Download the project as a zip.](https://github.com/femmeromantic/zencord/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Open `about:addons`
- Press the gear in the top right corner
- Press "Install Add-on From File..."
- Open the downloaded zip.
